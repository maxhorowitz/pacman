We assume you have the `conda` installed on your machine. If you don't, install it first.
For first time running, you need to create a virtual environment on your machine that has all of the necessary dependencies. To do this, run `make init-env`.
Once the virtual environment is set up, run `make start-venv` to enter the environment.
To leave the virtual environment when you are done playing, run `make leave-venv`.
